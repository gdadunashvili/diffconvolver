# diffconvolver
a very very very simple finite difference solver package for python

# difconvolver

This project originated as a way to solve a specific coupled PDE system.

It implements several classes that make setting up an FDM script easy like:
A class to generate a 
	- 2D Grid
	- spacial derivative operators
	- bulk updaters
	- general updaters for double-periodic b.c.'s

The project is not really general as is but is easily generalisable to different PDE aystems
